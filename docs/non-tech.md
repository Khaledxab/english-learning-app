### How It Works

   - If grammar is your weakness, more grammar questions will appear

3. **Progressive Difficulty**:
   As you improve, questions become more challenging:
   - Level 1 contains basic concepts
   - Higher levels introduce more complex language elements
   - The difficulty increases gradually to ensure optimal learning

4. **Learning Reinforcement**:
   Questions you answer incorrectly may reappear in future sessions to reinforce learning
